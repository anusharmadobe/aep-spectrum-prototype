# AEP Spectrum Prototype - Rapid UI Prototyping Tool 🚀

A powerful rapid prototyping tool for Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) Spectrum that enables developers to build and fine-tune UI components from screenshots using AI-based tooling. This tool streamlines the prototyping process by starting from visual references and iteratively improving designs through supportive AI assistance.

## 🌟 Features

- **Screenshot-to-UI Pipeline** - Upload screenshots and generate UI prototypes
- **AI-Powered Analysis** - Intelligent component extraction and structure generation
- **Rapid Iteration** - Quick feedback loops for design refinement
- **AEP Spectrum Integration** - Built specifically for Adobe Experience Platform
- **Stage-wise Development** - Systematic approach to UI building and fine-tuning
- **Real-time Processing** - Live feedback during prototype generation
- **Responsive Design** - Works across desktop and mobile devices

## 🎯 Purpose

This tool addresses the need for rapid prototyping in the AEP ecosystem by:

1. **Starting from Screenshots** - Convert visual designs into functional prototypes
2. **AI-Based UI Generation** - Leverage artificial intelligence for component creation
3. **Stage-wise Refinement** - Systematic approach to building and fine-tuning
4. **Supportive Tooling** - AI assistance throughout the development process

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Modern web browser

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anusharmadobe/aep-spectrum-prototype.git
   cd aep-spectrum-prototype
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Alternative: Direct File Access
You can also open `index.html` directly in your browser for a quick preview.

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Upload Screenshot** - Click the upload button and select your design screenshot
2. **AI Processing** - Watch as AI analyzes and extracts UI components
3. **Prototype Generation** - Get a functional prototype based on your screenshot
4. **Iterate and Refine** - Use the supportive AI tooling to fine-tune your design
5. **Export for AEP** - Generate code ready for Adobe Experience Platform integration

## 🤖 AI-Based Tooling

The prototype includes three core AI tools:

### 1. AI Analysis 🤖
- Screenshot analysis and component detection
- Layout structure recognition
- Design pattern identification

### 2. UI Generation 🎨
- Automatic code generation
- Component structure creation
- Styling and theming application

### 3. Rapid Iteration ⚡
- Quick feedback loops
- Real-time refinement
- Continuous improvement suggestions

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Stage 1: Screenshot Upload
- Upload design reference
- File validation and processing
- Initial analysis preparation

### Stage 2: AI Processing
- Component extraction
- Structure analysis
- Code generation planning

### Stage 3: Prototype Generation
- UI component creation
- Styling application
- AEP Spectrum integration

### Stage 4: Fine-tuning
- Iterative improvements
- AI-assisted refinement
- Final optimization

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New AI Tools
Extend the AI tooling by modifying the `aiTools` array in `script.js`:

```javascript
this.aiTools = [
    { icon: '🤖', label: 'AI Analysis' },
    { icon: '🎨', label: 'UI Generation' },
    { icon: '⚡', label: 'Rapid Iteration' },
    // Add your custom tools here
];
```

### Customizing Processing Steps
Modify the processing pipeline in the `processingSteps` array:

```javascript
this.processingSteps = [
    "Analyzing screenshot...",
    "Extracting UI components...",
    "Generating code structure...",
    // Add your custom steps
];
```

### AEP Integration
The tool includes pre-configured AEP integration files:
- `adobe-experience-platform-ia.json` - Basic configuration
- `adobe-experience-platform-ia-enhanced.json` - Advanced setup

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start the development server
- `npm run dev` - Alternative start command

### Server Configuration

The Express.js server runs on port 3000 by default. Modify the port in `server.js`:

```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
```

## 📱 Browser Support
