# Rapid UI Prototyping Project from screenshot🚀

A powerful rapid prototyping project to build product UI from screenshot and fine tune / update it using augmented AI-based tooling. This project provides the prototyping process by starting from visual references and iteratively improving designs through supportive AI assistance.

## 🌟 Features

- **Screenshot-to-UI Pipeline** - Upload screenshots and generate UI prototypes
- **AI-Powered Analysis** - Intelligent component extraction and structure generation
- **Rapid Iteration** - Quick feedback loops for design refinement
- **AEP Spectrum Integration** - Built specifically for Adobe Experience Platform
- **Stage-wise Development** - Systematic approach to UI building and fine-tuning
- **Real-time Processing** - Live feedback during prototype generation
- **Responsive Design** - Works across desktop and mobile devices

## 🎯 Purpose

This tool addresses the need for rapid prototyping in the AEP ecosystem by:

1. **Starting from Screenshots** - Convert visual designs into functional prototypes
2. **AI-Based UI Generation** - Leverage artificial intelligence for component creation
3. **Stage-wise Refinement** - Systematic approach to building and fine-tuning
4. **Supportive Tooling** - AI assistance throughout the development process

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Modern web browser

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anusharmadobe/aep-spectrum-prototype.git
   cd aep-spectrum-prototype
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Alternative: Direct File Access
You can also open `index.html` directly in your browser for a quick preview.

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Upload Screenshot** - Click the upload button and select your design screenshot in Cursor IDE
2. **AI Processing** - Watch as AI analyzes and extracts UI components
3. **Prototype Generation** - Get a functional prototype based on your screenshot
4. **Iterate and Refine** - Use the supportive AI tooling Stagewise to fine-tune your design

📖 **For detailed step-by-step instructions and the complete prototyping process, see the [UI Development Guide](UI-Development-Guide.md)**
