## 1. Initial Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git
- A modern code editor (VS Code, Cursor, etc.)

### Project Structure
```

## 2. Screenshot Analysis & Information Architecture

### Step 1: Analyze the Screenshot

**ü§ñ AI Prompt for Screenshot Analysis:**
```
I have a screenshot of a UI that I want to recreate. Please analyze this image and identify:

1. Layout structure (header, sidebar, main content areas)
2. Navigation elements (menus, tabs, buttons, breadcrumbs)
3. Content sections (cards, lists, forms, tables)
4. Visual hierarchy (typography sizes, colors, spacing)
5. Interactive elements (buttons, inputs, dropdowns, checkboxes)
6. Color scheme and styling patterns
7. Responsive considerations (how it might adapt to different screen sizes)

Please provide a detailed breakdown of each UI component you can identify.
```

### Step 2: Create Information Architecture JSON

**ü§ñ AI Prompt for JSON Creation:**
```
Based on the UI analysis, create a comprehensive JSON file that captures the information architecture. The JSON should include:

1. UI structure with nested components
2. Component properties (text, colors, dimensions)
3. Layout specifications (flexbox, grid, positioning)
4. Interactive states (hover, active, disabled)
5. Responsive breakpoints
6. Accessibility considerations

Format it as a structured JSON with clear hierarchy and detailed component definitions.
```

```json
{
  "ui_structure": {
    "header": {
      "components": ["logo", "search", "user_menu"],
      "layout": "horizontal",
      "styling": "dark_theme"
    },
    "sidebar": {
      "navigation_items": ["sources", "destinations", "datasets"],
      "layout": "vertical",
      "width": "280px"
    },
    "main_content": {
      "sections": ["sources_tabs", "categories", "application_cards"],
      "layout": "grid"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Enhanced Architecture (Optional)
For complex UIs, create an enhanced version with:
- **UI element placement** (exact positioning)
- **User flow** (navigation paths)
- **Responsive behavior** (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- **Visual hierarchy** (font sizes, colors, spacing)
- **Accessibility features** (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

---

## 3. React App Creation

### Step 1: Create React App with React Spectrum

**ü§ñ AI Prompt for Project Setup:**
```
Create a React TypeScript application using React Spectrum design system. Set up the project structure with:

1. React app with TypeScript
2. React Spectrum design system
3. Basic component structure for header, sidebar, and main content
4. Proper TypeScript configuration

Use the enhanced JSON structure I created earlier to build the components directly.
```

**Terminal Commands:**
```bash
npx create-react-app AEP-spectrum-prototype --template typescript
cd AEP-spectrum-prototype
npm install @adobe/react-spectrum
```

### Step 2: Build Components from Enhanced JSON

**ü§ñ AI Prompt for Component Implementation:**
```
Using this enhanced JSON structure, create the complete React components:

[Paste the enhanced JSON from Step 2]

Build these components using React Spectrum:
1. Header component with search and user actions
2. Sidebar component with navigation
3. MainContent component with tabs
4. SourcesContent component with categories and cards

Use the exact specifications from the JSON for styling, layout, and functionality.
```

### Step 3: Integrate All Components

**ü§ñ AI Prompt for App Integration:**
```
Create the main App component that integrates all the components using React Spectrum Provider. The app should:

1. Use React Spectrum Provider with default theme
2. Implement the exact layout from the enhanced JSON
3. Handle all the interactions specified in the JSON
4. Match the visual design exactly

Make sure all components work together seamlessly.
```

## 4. Start Development Server

### Step 1: Start the App

**Terminal Commands:**
```bash
npm start
```

**Access your app at:** `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 2: Verify Implementation

**ü§ñ AI Prompt for Verification:**
```
I've built the React app using React Spectrum and the enhanced JSON. Please help me verify that:

1. All components are rendering correctly
2. The layout matches the original design
3. All interactions are working
4. The styling is consistent

If there are any issues, help me fix them quickly.
```

## 5. Setup Stagewise for AI Development

### Step 1: Install and Configure Stagewise

**Terminal Commands:**
```bash
# Authenticate with Stagewise
npx stagewise@latest auth login

# Start Stagewise (in another terminal)
npx stagewise@latest
```

### Step 2: Access AI-Powered Development

**Access your AI-enhanced app at:** `http://localhost:3001`

### Step 3: Use AI to Improve the UI

**ü§ñ AI Prompt for UI Improvements:**
```
I have my React app running with Stagewise. I want to improve the UI by:

1. [Describe what you want to change]
2. [Click on the element you want to modify]
3. [Describe the desired outcome]

Please help me make these changes using Stagewise.
```
